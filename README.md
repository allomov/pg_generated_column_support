NOTE:

# Pg Generated Column Support

This is a backport of the generated column support that was added to
Rails 7: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/41856

It also includes fixes from two other PRs:
I also pulled in changes from two other related PRs:
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43263
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44319

Much thanks and appreciation to everyone who worked on the
generated columns support PRs. :heart::tada:

NOTE: Generated columns are supported since version 12.0 of PostgreSQL.
